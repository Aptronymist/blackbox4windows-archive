# blackbox4windows-archive
Welcome!

It seems the bb4win website http://blackbox4windows.com is under frequent attack, so to get access to the various up-to-date blackbox builds, you have to contact an admin at the very least before you can download anything or even see pictures.
I of course did so, and had a pleasant email exchange with Pitkon, but I decided that it would be great if I just put the files online somewhere myself to make things easier for anyone else that might be looking for them. 

It is not exactly easy to locate some of this stuff, many of the old sites are long dead, domains repurposed, etc. There is source code here and there, but most people probably don't want to be trying to compile source code from 7-20 years ago. There is of course https://github.com/xoblite/ out there already, so I won't archive it.

Older computer geeks deserve to relive our youth of custom windows shells, and creatively inclined younger computer geeks deserve to be able to easily have access to them as well!

I haven't used alternate windows shells like this in a long time, but I was quite a fan back in the late 90s and early 00s (mostly LiteStep iirc) so I will endeavor to organize this all properly (perhaps someone might volunteer to assist?), as I myself get a hang of things and tinker with my own custom blackbox desktop.

I'll also try to dig up and store documentaion as best I can, I'll be needing that myself after not having touched any of these in at least 15 years!
